# Push Button Photo

A practice project based on the ***Tweeting Babbage*** project by the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](www.raspberrypi.org) at https://github.com/raspberrypilearning/tweeting-babbage

A Raspberry Pi is set up with camera board, and a push button and three LEDs connected to a breadboard. When the button is pressed, the LEDs flash to form a countdown. When the countdown is complete, a photo is taken and posted to Twitter via Python.
